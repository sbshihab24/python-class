#Declaring Variables
x = 10         # Integer
y = 3.14       # Float
name = "Alice" # String
is_valid = True # Boolean

#Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning their type can change based on the assigned value:
x = 10          # Integer
x = "Hello"     # Now a String
x = 3.14        # Now a Float

# Assigning multiple variables in one line
a, b, c = 10, 20, "Python"
print(a, b, c)       # Output: 10 20 Python

# Assigning the same value to multiple variables
x = y = z = 0
print(x, y, z)       # Output: 0 0 0
